# profilemyjobs
a lightweight, long-run system profiler writ in bash & visualized with gnuplot


## Background

In many computational environments, especially in clusters where jobs often run in batch mode disconnected from a user terminal, it's difficult to determine why a job is running slowly or not at all.  'profilemyjobs' & its batch wrapper 'pmj' assist in profiling long-running jobs by capturing many system variables to a log and presenting them nearly real-time via 'gnuplot' (if running in a connected X11 terminal), or after the fact by running the autogenerated 'gnuplot' script.  It differs from many such tools by plotting the values in the same pane, allowing near-realtime viewing of those values, and (via gnuplot/Qt), zooming/panning/value-by-mouse-over.
